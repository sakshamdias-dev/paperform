## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A Supabase project for backend data storage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

*(You can refer to the `supabase-setup.sql` file in the root directory for setting up your database schema).*

### Running the Development Server

Start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
- `npm run build`: Compiles TypeScript and builds the application for production.
- `npm run preview`: Bootstraps a local web server to preview the production build.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint for code quality checks.
